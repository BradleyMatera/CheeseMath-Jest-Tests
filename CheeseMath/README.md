# 🧀 CheeseMath Module

Welcome to the **CheeseMath** project! This project is all about having fun with basic arithmetic operations using a cheese-themed twist. We’ve got you covered with adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, finding square roots, and even identifying the maximum amount of cheese. 🍕🧀

## 📋 Project Overview

CheeseMath includes several JavaScript functions, each performing a basic math operation, but with a fun, cheesy theme! Each function is modularized for easy testing and use. The project also includes a basic Express server to handle these operations via API endpoints.

## 🔧 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

### 1. **Create Project Directory:**

- Open terminal.
- Navigate to your workspace directory.
- Create a new directory for your project.
- Navigate into the project directory.

### 2. **Initialize Node Project:**

- Run `npm init -y` to generate a `package.json` file.

### 3. **Install Dependencies:**

- In the project directory, run `npm install express dotenv nodemon jest` to install the necessary dependencies.

### 4. **Set Up Directory Structure:**

- Create separate files in the project directory for each function:
  - `addCheese.js`
  - `subtractCheese.js`
  - `multiplyCheese.js`
  - `divideCheese.js`
  - `cheeseSqrt.js`
  - `maxCheese.js`
- Create an `index.js` file for routing logic.
- Create a `server.js` file to start the server.
- Create a test file named `cheeseMath.test.js` in a `tests/` directory.

### 5. **Configure Jest in `package.json`:**

- Open `package.json`.
- Add `"test": "jest"` under `"scripts"`.

### 6. **Write Code and Tests:**

- Write the function code in each respective `.js` file.
- Write corresponding tests in `cheeseMath.test.js`.

### 7. **Run Tests:**

- In the project directory, run `npm test` to execute all Jest tests.

### 8. **Set Up and Run the Server:**

- To start the server, run `npm start` from the project directory.
- The server will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 9. **Test the API Endpoints:**

- Use a browser or Postman to test the API endpoints, such as:
  - `http://localhost:3000/cheese/add?a=3&b=2`
  - `http://localhost:3000/cheese/subtract?a=5&b=2`
  - `http://localhost:3000/cheese/multiply?a=4&b=3`
  - `http://localhost:3000/cheese/divide?a=10&b=2`
  - `http://localhost:3000/cheese/sqrt?a=16`
  - `http://localhost:3000/cheese/max?a=10&b=20`

### 10. **Troubleshoot and Debug (if necessary):**

- If any issues arise, review your routes, check the server logs, or revisit the test results for insights.

### 11. **Commit Code (Optional):**

- Initialize a Git repository (`git init`).
- Add files to staging (`git add .`).
- Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Initial commit"`).

## 🧀 Functions Overview

### 1. **addCheese**

- Adds two numbers (slices of cheese).

### 2. **subtractCheese**

- Subtracts the second number from the first (slices of cheese).

### 3. **multiplyCheese**

- Multiplies two numbers (blocks of cheese by slices per block).

### 4. **divideCheese**

- Divides the first number by the second (blocks of cheese among people).

### 5. **cheeseSqrt**

- Calculates the square root of a number (slices of cheese).

### 6. **maxCheese**

- Returns the maximum of two numbers (blocks of cheese).

## 🧪 Testing

- Each function has been thoroughly tested using Jest.
- Tests are located in the `tests/cheeseMath.test.js` file and cover various scenarios to ensure all operations are working as expected.

## 🚀 Running the Project

To run the server and see the CheeseMath module in action:

1. **Run the Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Run the Tests:**

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

Watch the cheese-themed operations come to life in your terminal and through your API endpoints!
